Welcome:
<$FFFFFF$>
You have been accepted into the <$FF00FF$>EsoBinaria Research Program<$FFFFFF$>.
Our goal here is to <$FF0000$>[REDACTED]<$FFFFFF$> the EsoBinaria device.
To do this we must understand how it works.
We have a tome documenting its inputs and outputs but no instructions for how to build the device.
You aim is to recreate small parts of the mechanism via reverse-<$FF0000$>[REDACTED]<$FFFFFF$>.
<$00FF00$>
Mission Statement:
<$FFFFFF$>
We are the binary star system, two parts that orbit each other.
We are the eternal void.
We are the light.
We are the EsoBinaria, the device that we seek to <$FF0000$>[REDACTED]<$FFFFFF$>.
