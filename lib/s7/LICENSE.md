  Apparently tinyScheme is under the BSD license, so I guess s7 is too.
  Here is Snd's verbiage which can apply here:

  The authors hereby grant permission to use, copy, modify, distribute,
  and license this software and its documentation for any purpose.  
  No written agreement, license, or royalty fee is required.  
  Modifications to this software may be copyrighted by their authors 
  and need not follow the licensing terms described here.

  followed by the usual all-caps shouting about liability.
